	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>My name is Qasim Alyas but most people call me kas, it&rsquo;s simpler, right? </p>
	<p>I currently work for <a href="http://abacusemedia.com">Abacus e-Media</a> as a front-end developer and am passionate about HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Accessibility and more.</p>
	<p>This site is mainly a playground for me to do some experimental stuff with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript so it might not look the best in a browser like Internet Explorer. I could have spent some extra time making it work but I want to show off the capabilities of these new technologies. It will look much better in modern browsers like, <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari</a>, <a href="http://getfirefox.com">FireFox</a> or <a href="http://google.co.uk/chrome">Chrome</a>. These are all faster and free!</p>
