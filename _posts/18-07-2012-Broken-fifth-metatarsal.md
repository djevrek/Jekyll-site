<h2>Swollen foot - 20<sup>th</sup> July 2012</h2>
I don't know why but last night was totally uncomfortable for me. I keep my foot elevated but did wake up with a swollen foot. I do also feel that the cast is a little lose. Maybe it's just me. But I'm hoping that I get some decent sleep tonight. Working from home was a real challange today.

<h2>Changed plaster - 18<sup>th</sup> July 2012</h2>
I went to the Orthopaedics today and had my cast changed. It's blue this time but it is bit better now. Just need to keep it elevated, drink milk, eat fruit etc etc. I&rsquo;ll be having my xray on the 21st August.

<h2>Consultant review - 17<sup>th</sup> July 2012</h2>
I saw the consultant today and he advised that I will need to be in a cast for an additional 4-5 weeks and will reassess then to see if the bone has healed. The break is near the joint where there isn't much blood supply so if I eat right the bone should heal. If it doesn't then they will have to insert a pin to hold it - which means more casts. :( 

I'm desperatly hoping it heals on its own.

I also had a lighter cast put on and it is quite tight but I spent the night sleeping ok - but the cast is too tight, digs into the wound and ankle.
<h2>Broken fifth metatarsal - 8<sup>th</sup> July 2012</h2>
I was playing (running) around with my son and broke my fifth metatarsal, a Jones fracture. I went straight to hospital and was examined by the nurse who put me in a plaster cast (slab). I didn't get home until 2:15am.
